# avatar-framer

A simple tool to create framed profile pictures for social media in support of a cause. Dynamically generate a static site based off of configuration options and the number of frame images provided. Just provide the images, a logo and your copy. Runs entirely in your browser (no images are uploaded to a server) to minimize privacy concerns. Based on http://avatar.joebiden.com.

**Demo:** http://andrewquinn.ca/avatar-framer/

**Goal:** Create an easily configurable static site, that can be quickly generated in a few minutes to support whatever cause you're working on.
